# Backup Event Streams

I am putting up 3 options for backing up / restoring EventStreams. They all have their own pros and cons. 
Option to used will be based on the requirements. 

1. [Backup and Restore using MM2](./georep_backup.md)
2. [Backup and Restore using Connectors](./s3_backup.md)
3. [Backup and Restore using File System Copy method](./file_system_copy.md)

A brief comparison of the 3 methods.
